        This is classic advice when operating in a large organization. You see a problem to be solved, have a bold solution in mind, and have everything necessary to take action, but there will be very real costs felt broadly. You think the tradeoff is worth it, but will your higher-ups agree? Or will they simply blame you for the costs without appreciating the problem solved?
      </p>
      <p>
        You likely have the best information on the decision but might assume you need permission to incur the costs. If your higher-ups assume the same then analysis paralysis sets in. If it’s a good idea, <em>go ahead and do it</em>. Grace Hopper encouraged a bias to action; to do the right thing for the org whether or not they know it to be. If you’re wrong or get flak for the costs: ask forgiveness; you acted in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        This good advice is missing one critical thing: <em>radiating intent</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While “forgiveness, not permission” considers what you’re asking, it says nothing about what you’re telling. If you anticipate needing to ask forgiveness after taking action then its best to get ahead of it by explaining the decision clearly immediately after you’ve made it. Even better, explain <em>before</em> you act then radiate it. Share far and wide.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind it becomes clear that rather than shifting from asking before to after you act, you should instead shift from asking to telling. Don’t seek permission, seek to inform. Radiating intent is telling what you will do before you do it.
      </p>

        Elizabeth Ayer, in her <a href="https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3" target="_blank">excellent article</a> on radiating intent explains why it’s a superior approach (which I’ve editorialized):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Invites participation from those with critical info or desire to help
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you’re wrong, it gives a chance for someone to stop you <em>before hand</em>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Leaves evidence of good faith. Better to be known as predictable than underhanded.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You keep responsibility and own the outcome, good or bad. Doesn’t transfer blame as seeking permission does.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sets the example that bold action is encouraged from everyone, not just organizational higher-ups.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. Say loudly what you are doing along the way. <em>Radiate intent!</em>

              This advice as quoted was popularized by all around badass Grace Hopper. However various forms <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/06/19/forgive/" target="_blank">have been cited</a>, back as far as St. Benedict in 500 AD. Likely some form of it has existed as long as there has been organized human society.
