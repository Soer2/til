# today i learned

A bunch of brief blurbs on miscellaneous matter; everyday things I learn and
things I know but sometimes forget. I write these mostly for myself, they're
not always definitive nor novel but hopefully helpful.

This collection began as a New Year's resolution for 2022 inspired by a
[similar resource][jbranchaud/til] by Josh Branchaud from which this project
gets its name and the fantastic [Learn in Public] essay by Shawn Wang.

This repo is automatically maintained by a `til` script, found in `/bin/til`,
symlinked into my `/.local/bin` directory. It relies on some local programs
being available, such as `vim` and `fzf`.

Setting this up for your own system in its current state might not be so
straightforward. If setting up your own til is interesting enough to you that
you would be willing to help factor out reusable parts, open an issue to
discuss.
