Years ago I came across this philosophy of "Ikigai" (or "life's reason") in [a
blog post][marc winn's blog post], along with an explanatory four-axis
venn-diagram[^meme seeding]. It introduced the concept of honing in on a life's
purpose by way of doing what you're good at, what you enjoy, what the world
needs, and what you can be paid for. This really resonated with me.

[^meme seeding]: Years later, Marc wrote a [follow up
post][marc winn's follow up] on the origins of his article on Ikigai and
addressed how it took on a life of its own.

I find this model a helpful tool in thinking about my own career, but it's
important to remember that it's just that: a model. While I like the framework,
as I've read more about Ikigai I also have some real concerns with it:

- It's mired in the pseudo-science of "self help" that I'm really suspicious of.
  Most books out there frame Ikigai as an elusive thing that you need to start
  searching for, won't find happiness without, and need coaching to achieve.

- It feels like yet another foreign cultural fetishization. Ikigai is a Japanese
  concept but nearly all material written on it is English.

- The origins of Ikigai's introduction to English readers is via a [TED
  talk][dan buettner's ted talk] on the unusual lives of centenarians on Okinawa
  Island which don't seem to relate to the venn-diagram, where did that come
  from?

These concerns turn out to be somewhat valid. In fact the origin of this
venn-diagram concept is not Japanese at all, but instead comes from a book by
Spanish Astrologist, Andrés Zuzunaga. [Marc Winn's blog post] combined [Andrés
Zuzunga's original graphic] with the idea of Ikigai presented in [Dan Buettner's
TED talk] and voilà.

Despite it's shortcomings and misappropriation I still really like this mental
model for considering career progression and debugging gaps in a sense of
fulfillment. Here's my translation of [Andrés Zuzunaga's original graphic] in
English:

Ikigai is still a very real concept, just not the same one as presented by most
of these blog posts and books. Japanese neuroscientist Ken Mogi (who has also
written a book on Ikigai) has [a video][ken mogi's video] addressing this
venn-diagram and attempting to reclaim the term back to a more original intent.
In the video he proposes a new (crude, hand-drawn) diagram to take its place
with two distinct changes:

- The four circles of the venn-diagram are replaced with two axis: small to big
  and private to public.

- Rather than Ikigai being found at the center of this diagram, he emphatically
  repeats that _all of it_ is Ikigai.

The goal being not to find the one perfect thing which checks all boxes to
define your life's reason but instead to cultivate a broad diversity of things
big and small, public and private, to bring a rich multifaceted purpose to life.
I took liberty in capturing Ken's "true Ikigai diagram" with a few additions in
a similar spirit:
