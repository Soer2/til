[Conway's law][] is an expression coined by computer scientist Melvin Conway as
an observation that companies tend to design software in a way which directly
mirrors their organization and communication structures.

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design
> whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

This is often used as an observation of poor software quality. Overlay complex
and disconnected software corresponds with similarly dysfunctional
organizations.

However the _inverse_ can be a useful tool when building organizations when you
can do so downwind of a desired saliently designed system, and thus use the
resulting org structure to accelerate towards the desired architecture. In doing
so, you ensure your organization best serves the users of the system
(presumably, your customers) rather than being self-serving[^1].

[^1]:
    It might seem reasonable to want your org design to serve yourself, but this
    is a form of [Muda][], or a way to define "waste" as inefficiencies in
    serving customer value.
