[Conway's law][] is an expression from the computer scientist Melvin Conway upon
noticing that companies tend to design software in a way which directly mirrors
their organization structure.

> Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure
> is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

This is often used as an observation of poor software quality. Overlay complex
and disconnected software corresponds with similarly dysfunctional
organizations.

However the _inverse_ can be a useful tool when building organizations when you
can do so downwind of a desired saliently designed system, and thus use the
resulting org structure to accelerate towards the desired architecture.
