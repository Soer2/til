Most New Year's resolutions fail. Gym memberships spike in January followed by a
surge of cancellations weeks later. There's some
[research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2980864/) suggesting that fewer than
one in five have resolutions that last through a second year. Creating new
habits is hard, kicking existing ones is even harder.

I'm approaching 2024 with two variations on a resolution: a motif and
fortnights.

## Motif

I'm choosing a single word as a motif representing the year ahead. It should be
somewhat aspirational and intentionally non-concrete. It is not a goal in itself
but should guide decision making, inform habits and goals. It's intentional
[psychological priming](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)>).

This year's motif is _restoration_.

Restoration is meant to be interpreted broadly. It involves anything aimed at
renewing or revitalizing myself physically, mentally, emotionally, or
spiritually, going beyond mere rest to replenish energy, balance, and overall
well-being.

## Fortnights

Rather than choose one habit or goal for the year, I'm taking on a new one every
fortnight, or every two weeks. Each fortnight's goal will relate to the
restoration motif. I'm going to approach this as a scientist. What is
restorative to me? The goal is not to change my habits (though I hope at least a
few stick) but to learn, fail often, and attempt to answer this question.

I'll do six of these experiments per season, with one week breaks interspersed.

## Addendum: Restoration framework

To help explore ideas for restoration experiments, I've created a five-axis
framework inspired by
[Maslow's Heirarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs),
[Ikigai](https://leebyron.com/til/ikigai/), and
[Dimensional Wellness](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellness_(alternative_medicine)>):

1. **Physiological**: Rejuvenate the body and replenish energy. Includes sleep,
   diet, and fitness.
2. **Cognitive**: Reduce cognitive stress and fatigue, enhance executive
   function, foster mental well-being, satisfy creativity and curiosity.
3. **Sensory**: Reduce external stress, enrich senses, seek beauty, and create
   or be in harmonious environments.
4. **Social-emotional**: Foster emotional resilience, social belonging, high
   esteem and self-respect.
5. **Purpose**: Be impactful, grow professionally, parent well.

I'll interpret each axis along an _active/passive_ spectrum. Each will be
interpreted in slightly different ways, but active actions should push
boundaries and present worthwhile challenges while passive ones should be
restful and at times indulgent.
