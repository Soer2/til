This is a paragraph with _italics_, and **bold** text, as well as
~strikethrough~. Here is `inline *code*` and below is a block of typescript
code:

```ts
function foo(bar: string): number {
  return (bar + 'quote').length
}
```

who knows how to highlight this?
```

<YouTube v="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

And one with an expression and fragment:

<>
  <div
    style={{
      color: `rgb(${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255}, ${
        Math.random() * 255
      })`
    }}
