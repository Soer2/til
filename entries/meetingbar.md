As a manager I live and die by my calendar. While Google Calendar gives me a
birds-eye view, what I need at a glance is where I'm supposed to be and how I'm
supposed to get there. I've tried many plugins and apps and my favorite is
incredibly simple: [MeetingBar].

MeetingBar sits in your menu bar and at a glance shows either your next meeting
along with a countdown until it starts or your current meeting and time
remaining. Click to drop open a menu with an item for each calendar entry for
the day. Choose an item to immediately open the attached Google Meet or Zoom
link.

There are quite a few nice details beyond this, but that's the gist. Oh, and
it's open source and can be installed with brew:

```sh
brew install meetingbar
```
