Ever seen this git error message while creating and pushing a new branch before
opening a PR?

```
fatal: The current branch my-pr-change has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin my-pr-change
```

Perhaps you have a script you use which automates setting this upstream for your
new branches, but as of
[git v2.37](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy1xinf00.fsf@gitster.g/T/) which was
released June 2022, Git can handle this directly.

From your terminal, run:

```
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
```

This allows a simple `git push` to automatically create remote branches to
match.
