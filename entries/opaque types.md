One of my favorite features from Flow is [opaque types]. This allows a
separation between interface and implementation that's incredibly helpful as a
type API designer, and a rare example of a "nominal type" in an otherwise
"structural type" environment. Unfortunately, TypeScript still does not support
this functionality.

1. I use this as a much simpler version of [private fields] that doesn't require
   a class interface and is scoped to a whole module rather than just a single
   class (fantastically helpful for a more functional programming style).

2. This is a great way to generate "subtypes" of a primitive like a string or
   number, which is particularly useful for representing things like URLs,
   UUIDs, and other things which are string-like but not strings.

You can emulate this behavior in TypeScript by lying to the compiler. For
example, let's create a `UUID` type:

```typescript
export type UUID = string & { [$uuid]: true }
declare const $uuid: unique symbol

export function isUUID(value: unknown): value is UUID {
  return uuid.validate(value)
}

export function createUUID(): UUID {
  return uuid.v4() as UUID
}
```

This introduces the type `UUID` which you can use anywhere you use a string, but
you can also write functions that accept only a `UUID` and not just any string.

This works by telling TypeScript that there exists a variable called `$uuid`
that is a [unique symbol] (the result of calling `Symbol()`) and that the type
`UUID` is both a `string` and (`&`) an object with a required property of that
unique symbol[^why]. However none of this exists at runtime, there is no
variable or unique symbol, so there's no way of actually creating a `UUID` type
outside of casting, which we only do in this bit of library code.

[^why]:
    There are variants of this technique, a common alternative being
    `{_brand: typeof $uuid}` but I like this one the best for a couple reasons.
    I don't like the IDE showing `._brand` in the typeahead completion; it will
    not show a symbol property. I find it slightly more helpful to
    [see the name of the symbol shown](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/PTAEFkE9QBwJwKYDMF0QE1AFwQYwBYB2AlgI4CuCAUAgB4wD2cW2kMCoAqpwJIAioALygAzljjFCAc1AAyUAG9QAbQAk5csXQBdAFzY4lUAF8q6PABsAholC4GhMaHWb0+8iQocRkALYAjBgszSxsOJA9cLGIHUGIRbn4ACgA3KwtKd0IAa0IGAHdCAEp9NIyOeK5ePioqEFAAQTsGX19Y9Jw4QitolOo6RmZWdlAAUV8rYgshUXFJGXklAH0l-zgrQnQV-Sw2BAYkZwQJqZMQ3Gtbe0cWVWPJiyyyIx8AoPPL8Mjo2Pjxh9S6UyoA8uQKxVKQIqIjGJ2CdTAAGEWjAwth8BxUHAmKBfAgRCIrFJ8VRrk48lgGok+PpqTMAOQARgATABmemkhzkhiUwj-Kb6fnTYRMtn0oA)
    when encountering an error .

Perhaps you don't actually want to expose that `UUID` is implemented as a
`string`, just remove the `string &`:

```typescript
export type UUID = { [$uuid]: true }
```

This version cannot be used where a `string` is expected, even though it's still
a string value at runtime.

This works surprisingly well, but there are shortcomings:

- Errors are not specifically helpful. Provide the wrong value where `UUID` is
  expected and see the details of this hack exposed.
- This pattern is a bit inscrutable compared to Flow's clearer explicit syntax.
  Don't forget to include a comment explaining what this does.
- There's still no concept of "module private" fields without going around the
  type compiler yet again.
- (As of TS v4.5) Equality checks require explicit typecasts. For example
  `userEmail === "admin@site.co"` will fail tsc with "This condition will always
  return false". This example can be resolved with the typecast
  `"admin@site.co" as Email`.

More examples of where opaque types are useful:

- `URL`, `Email`, `Username`, `ID` or anything else you might want to validate
  before using and offer a guarantee that if you have a value of that type, it
  has been validated.
- HTML sanitization, to type a string which has been HTML sanitized, while
  having unsafe functions that accept only sanitized strings.
- Subtypes of number, like integers or positive values.
- Opaque types for numeric or string database IDs which may be used alongside
  other strings or numbers.
- Unique types for overlapping identifiers such as classic MySQL auto increments
  that you'd hate to mix up, like `UserID` and `MessageID`.

I'd still love to see explicit support for this long-loved feature from Flow
built into TypeScript, but this technique works reasonably well despite the
shortcomings.
