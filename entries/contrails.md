[![Flights with warming and cooling contrails on a map](../media/b9131a06528b711b.png)](https://map.contrails.org/)

Air flights have a surprisingly complex impact on climate warming. In addition
to burning jet fuel emitting COâ‚‚ and other greenhouse gasses, the contrails left
behind linger as artificial clouds. These contrails act as a blanket both
trapping thermal heat as well as reflecting away solar radiation. The net effect
of which could be warming _or cooling_[^1].

Many factors impact this net effect including the duration, path of flight,
changes in altitude, wind speed, and most significantly time of day. The physics
involved mean the sunlight reflective effects of a contrail can only occur in
the daytime; without this a contrail can only have a warming effect. To maximize
a net-cooling effect, contrails need to be formed early in the day so they can
reflect sunlight for their duration.

Factoring the effects of contrails into the overall climate impact of air travel
means that not all flights are equal offenders. The top 5% of flights contribute
roughly a third of overall climate warming effects. Modest routing and timing
adjustments could have an outsized impact on the overall climate impact of air
travel.

And yes, this is just one more reason why red eye flights are awful.
