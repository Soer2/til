In macOS, when you hold down a letter key you see a small popover with available
alternates for that letter (for example by applying accents). The behavior can
be disabled to return to an older behavior of key repeatâ€”where holding a key
repeats that letter until you release it.

To do so for a specific app:

```sh
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

Or to disable system wide:

```sh
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

After changing this setting, you need to restart the app or whole sign in
session.
