If you have a bit-powered display where the elements don't align to the bits in
the byte, you may want to remap bits from the source byte to the destination
byte. Manually writing a bunch of shifts is frustrating, and I found a great
tool which writes this code for you!

I just used this to map sprite binary data to Unicode
[braille patterns](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/braille_patterns/list.htm).
The 8 dots in a braille pattern can map to a byte, but perhaps not in the order
you expect.
